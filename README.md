# PumlPreview.nvim

## Default config

```lua
local default_opts = {
    render_type = "text",
    render_on_write = false,
}
```

## What is working for now

- Rendering plantuml files in text form
- Open new buffer

## What need to be done

- [ ] Add render on write
- [ ] Add image preview
- [ ] Add image exporting
- [ ] File type Checking for plantuml endings (puml, plantuml)

## Contribution

I'm **new** to open source and this is my first plugin for `NeoVim`.
So please feel free to add some changes and help me out.
My Goal is to make it possible to have a good integrated
tooling for generating Uml's for your project.
